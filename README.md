Sky Transport Performance Dashboard
Welcome to the Sky Transport Performance Dashboard project! This repository contains all files and documentation for an advanced business intelligence dashboard developed in Power BI, designed to provide actionable insights into transport operations, revenue, and customer analytics.

Project Overview
The Sky Transport Performance Dashboard enables teams to visualize, analyze, and optimize transport operations using interactive KPIs, tables, and charts. It helps decision-makers stay informed about revenue streams, trip patterns, top-performing regions, and customer contributions—empowering data-driven business strategies.

Key Features
Executive KPIs: Instantly view total revenue, miles covered, and number of trips.
Customer & Trip Type Analysis: Breakdowns of revenue, mileage, and business volume by customer and trip type (domestic, intercom, international).
Geographic Insights: Visualizations for revenue and trip counts by state and city—identify high-performing regions and key growth areas.
Operational Reporting: Track costs, revenue per mile, and other operational metrics for ongoing performance improvement.
Interactivity: Slicers and filters for customer name or trip type, enabling self-service analysis for diverse business questions.

Sample Visuals

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Connect your data sources if you want to replicate with your own dataset (see "Data Requirements" below).
Explore dashboard tabs, interact with slicers, and customize views as needed.

Data Requirements
To use your own data, ensure your dataset includes:

Customer ID/Name

Trip details (ID, type, state, city)
Revenue and cost fields
Total miles per trip
Column names can be customized in Power BI, but matching the demo structure will minimize editing.

Technologies Used
Power BI (DAX, Data Modeling, Interactive Visuals)
SQL (Data extraction and shaping)
Excel (Data preprocessing, validation)
ETL Concepts (Data cleanup, normalization, refresh schedules)
